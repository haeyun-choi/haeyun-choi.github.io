Before joining KT, I received my M.S. from [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/kor/index.do), where I conducted research in the [Computer Graphics Lab](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Sunghyun Cho](https://www.scho.pe.kr/).  

My research lies at the intersection of computer graphics and computer vision, with a focus on neural rendering techniques for real-world applications.
In addition to my work in graphics and vision, I also have experience in voice conversion and speech processing.

If you're interested in my research, feel free to reach out!
